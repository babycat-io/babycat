Many commands operate on codebases of one language. If you want to
only affect one language, then use the `-lang` suffix.

                                Manage Docker containers for this
                                project. We have three containers:

                                - cargo: Rust and Cargo

                                - main: Many versions of Python and
                                  developer tools

                                - pip: A container for building
                                  manylinux images

docker-build                    These commands build the containers.
