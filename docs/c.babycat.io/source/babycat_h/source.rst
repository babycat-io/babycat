babycat.h source code
=====================

When you compile software that uses Babycat's C APIs, typically the build process will automatically generate the ``babycat.h`` C header file. As a result, the babycat.h file cannot be found in our official GitHub repository.

However, we want to give you a preview of what ``babycat.h`` probably looks like.
Below is the copy of the ``babycat.h`` file **used to make this version of the Babycat documentation** (which is not necessarily the version of Babycat that you are using).
