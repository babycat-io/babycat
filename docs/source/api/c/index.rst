C header structure
------------------
Babycat's C bindings are automatically generated by `cbindgen <https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen>`_. Babycat's entire API is described in a single C header file named ``babycat.h``.

This documentation website splits the Babycat C API across multiple pages, but they all represent symbols directly inserted by `babycat.h`.

Data structures (structs and typedefs)
--------------------------------------

- :doc:`babycat_DecodeArgs/index`: A struct that describes settings for decoding audio.
- :doc:`babycat_Waveform/index`: A typedef struct that represents a single waveform in memory.
- :doc:`babycat_WaveformResult/index`: A struct that contains either an error code or a pointer to a :doc:`babycat_Waveform/index`.

``#define``-ed constants
------------------------

These constants represent default values for structs as well as error codes that can be returned.
