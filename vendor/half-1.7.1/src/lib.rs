//! A crate that provides support for half-precision 16-bit floating point types.
//!
//! This crate provides the [`f16`] type, which is an implementation of the IEEE 754-2008 standard
//! [`binary16`] a.k.a `half` floating point type. This 16-bit floating point type is intended for
//! efficient storage where the full range and precision of a larger floating point value is not
//! required. This is especially useful for image storage formats.
//!
//! This crate also provides a [`bf16`] type, an alternative 16-bit floating point format. The
//! [`bfloat16`] format is a truncated IEEE 754 standard `binary32` float that preserves the
//! exponent to allow the same range as `f32` but with only 8 bits of precision (instead of 11
//! bits for [`f16`]). See the [`bf16`] type for details.
//!
//! Because [`f16`] and [`bf16`] are primarily for efficient storage, floating point operations such as
//! addition, multiplication, etc. are not implemented. Operations should be performed with `f32`
//! or higher-precision types and converted to/from [`f16`] or [`bf16`] as necessary.
//!
//! This crate also provides a [`slice`] module for zero-copy in-place conversions of `u16` slices
//! to both [`f16`] and [`bf16`], as well as efficient vectorized conversions of larger buffers of
//! floating point values to and from these half formats.
//!
//! A [`prelude`] module is provided for easy importing of available utility traits.
//!
//! Some hardware architectures provide support for 16-bit floating point conversions. Enable the
//! `use-intrinsics` feature to use LLVM intrinsics for hardware conversions. This crate does no
//! checks on whether the hardware supports the feature. This feature currently only works on
//! nightly Rust due to a compiler feature gate. When this feature is enabled and the hardware
//! supports it, the [`slice`] trait conversions will use vectorized SIMD intructions for
//! increased efficiency.
//!
//! Support for [`serde`] crate `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits is provided when the `serde`
//! feature is enabled. This adds a dependency on [`serde`] crate so is an optional cargo feature.
//! Support for [`bytemuck`] crate `Zeroable` and `Pod` traits is provided with the `bytemuck`
//! feature. Support for the [`num-traits`] crate `ToPrimitive` and `FromPrimitive` traits is
//! provided with the `num-traits` feature.
//!
//! The crate uses `#[no_std]` by default, so can be used in embedded environments without using the
//! Rust `std` library. A `std` feature is available, which enables additional utilities using the
//! `std` library, such as the [`vec`] module that provides zero-copy `Vec` conversions. The `alloc`
//! feature may be used to enable the [`vec`] module without adding a dependency to the `std`
//! library.
