ndarray
=========

The ``ndarray`` crate provides an *n*-dimensional container for general elements
and for numerics.

Please read the `API documentation on docs.rs`__
or take a look at the `quickstart tutorial <./README-quick-start.md>`_.

Highlights
----------

- Generic 1, 2, ..., *n*-dimensional arrays
- Owned arrays and array views
- Slicing, also with arbitrary step size, and negative indices to mean
  elements from the end of the axis.
- Views and subviews of arrays; iterators that yield subviews.

Status and Lookout
------------------

- Still iterating on and evolving the crate

  + The crate is continuously developing, and breaking changes are expected
    during evolution from version to version. We adopt the newest stable
    rust features if we need them.

- Performance:

  + Prefer higher order methods and arithmetic operations on arrays first,
    then iteration, and as a last priority using indexed algorithms.
  + Efficient floating point matrix multiplication even for very large
    matrices; can optionally use BLAS to improve it further.

Crate Feature Flags
-------------------

The following crate feature flags are available. They are configured in
your `Cargo.toml`.

- ``serde``

  - Optional, compatible with Rust stable
  - Enables serialization support for serde 1.x

- ``rayon``

  - Optional, compatible with Rust stable
  - Enables parallel iterators, parallelized methods and ``par_azip!``.

- ``blas``

  - Optional and experimental, compatible with Rust stable
  - Enable transparent BLAS support for matrix multiplication.
    Uses ``blas-src`` for pluggable backend, which needs to be configured
    separately.

How to use with cargo
---------------------

::

    [dependencies]
    ndarray = "0.14.0"

How to enable blas integration. Depend on ``blas-src`` directly to pick a blas
provider. Depend on the same ``blas-src`` version as ``ndarray`` does, for the
selection to work.  A proposed configuration using system openblas is shown
below. Note that only end-user projects (not libraries) should select
provider::


    [dependencies]
    ndarray = { version = "0.14.0", features = ["blas"] }
    blas-src = { version = "0.6.1", default-features = false, features = ["openblas"] }
    openblas-src = { version = "0.9", default-features = false, features = ["cblas", "system"] }

For official releases of ``ndarray``, the versions are:

=========== ============ ================
``ndarray`` ``blas-src`` ``openblas-src``
=========== ============ ================
0.14.0      0.6.1        0.9.0
0.13.0      0.2.0        0.6.0
0.12.\*     0.2.0        0.6.0
0.11.\*     0.1.2        0.5.0
=========== ============ ================
