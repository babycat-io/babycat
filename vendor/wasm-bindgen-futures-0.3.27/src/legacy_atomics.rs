/// The `future` provided must adhere to `'static` because it'll be scheduled
/// to run in the background and cannot contain any stack references. The

/// depending on whether it finishes with `Ok` or `Err`.

/// Note that in wasm panics are currently translated to aborts, but "abort" in
/// this case means that a JavaScript exception is thrown. The wasm module is
/// still usable (likely erroneously) after Rust panics.
///
/// If the `future` provided panics then the returned `Promise` **will not
/// resolve**. Instead it will be a leaked promise. This is an unfortunate
/// limitation of wasm currently that's hoped to be fixed one day!

// promise to return as well as `Atomics.waitAsync` to create a promise that we
// can asynchronously wait on. The general idea here is that we'll create a
// promise to return and schedule work to happen in `Atomics.waitAsync`
// callbacks.
//
// After we've created a promise we start polling a future, and whenever it's
// not ready we'll execute `Atomics.waitAsync`. When that resolves we'll keep
// polling the future, and this happens until the future is done. Finally
// when it's all finished we call either resolver or reject depending on the
// result of the future.
