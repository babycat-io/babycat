/// Converts a Rust `Future` into a JavaScript `Promise`.

/// This function will take any future in Rust and schedule it to be executed,
/// returning a JavaScript `Promise` which can then be passed back to JavaScript
/// to get plumbed into the rest of a system.
///
/// The `future` provided must adhere to `'static` because it'll be scheduled
/// to run in the background and cannot contain any stack references. The
/// returned `Promise` will be resolved or rejected when the future completes,
/// depending on whether it finishes with `Ok` or `Err`.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Note that in wasm panics are currently translated to aborts, but "abort" in
/// this case means that a JavaScript exception is thrown. The wasm module is
/// still usable (likely erroneously) after Rust panics.
///
/// If the `future` provided panics then the returned `Promise` **will not
/// resolve**. Instead it will be a leaked promise. This is an unfortunate
/// limitation of wasm currently that's hoped to be fixed one day!

// Implementation of actually transforming a future into a JavaScript `Promise`.
//
// The only primitive we have to work with here is `Promise::new`, which gives
// us two callbacks that we can use to either reject or resolve the promise.
// It's our job to ensure that one of those callbacks is called at the
// appropriate time.
//
// Now we know that JavaScript (in general) can't block and is largely
// notification/callback driven. That means that our future must either have
// synchronous computational work to do, or it's "scheduled a notification" to
// happen. These notifications are likely callbacks to get executed when things
// finish (like a different promise or something like `setTimeout`). The general
// idea here is thus to do as much synchronous work as we can and then otherwise
// translate notifications of a future's task into "let's poll the future!"
//
// This isn't necessarily the greatest future executor in the world, but it
// should get the job done for now hopefully.
